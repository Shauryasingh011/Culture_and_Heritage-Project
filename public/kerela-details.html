<b>Now: </b>While western clothes and modern sarees are common, the Kasavu Saree and Mundu are still worn during weddings, Onam, Vishu, and cultural events.<br><br><br>

<b>In short: </b>Traditional dress has moved from everyday wear to cultural identity, celebrated especially during festivals.</p>

                        Kerala jewellery is traditionally made of gold, reflecting prosperity and elegance. Women adorn themselves with Kasavu Mala, Manga Mala (mango-shaped chain), Oddiyanam (waist belt), Elakkathali (neckpiece) and Jhimkis (earrings). 
                        <br><br>
                        Today, lighter versions and modern designs are popular, but during weddings and festivals, women still wear heavy layers of traditional ornaments. Gold remains a cultural symbol of wealth and pride in Kerala.

                        Kerala is famous for Kathakali, a classical dance-drama known for elaborate makeup and storytelling. Another unique art form is Theyyam, a ritual performance blending dance, drama, and devotion. 
                        <br><br>
                        Murals, coir crafts, and handloom weaving also form an important part of Kerala’s artistic identity. These art forms are not just entertainment but spiritual expressions connecting people to culture and tradition.
