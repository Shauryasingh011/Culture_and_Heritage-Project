                     fashion reimagined.</div>
                <p><b>Earlier: </b>Women mostly wore Ghagra, Choli, and Pichhora (yellow-red cloth symbol of marriage). Men wore Dhoti/Kurta with woolen shawls in cold regions. These were part of daily life.<br><br><br>

<b>Now: </b>People mostly wear modern clothes like sarees, salwar suits, shirts, trousers, and western wear. Pichhora is still worn by women, but only on weddings and religious occasions.<br><br><br>

<b> In short: </b>Traditional attire has shifted from daily wear to special occasions, while modern clothing is common today.</p>

                <p id="jwell">Jewellery was mainly silver, heavy, and symbolic. Women wore large Nath (nose ring), Hansuli/Chandrahaar (neckpiece), Pahunchi (gold bangles with velvet filling), and Bichhuwa (toe rings). These were worn for status, beauty, and protection from evil.
                                Jewellery is lighter and modern, often made in gold or alloys, though traditional styles remain popular in weddings and festivals. The Nath is still iconic, but everyday designs are simpler and practical.
                                Uttarakhand jewellery has moved from heavy, symbolic ornaments to lighter, fashionable versions, while still keeping its cultural roots alive</p>

                <p id="aipan">Aipan art, originating in Kumaon (Uttarakhand), is a ritual folk art drawn by women using rice paste on red clay backgrounds to invoke prosperity and ward off evil. Traditionally made on floors, walls, and puja chowkis during ceremonies, it symbolized spirituality and cultural identity. With modernization, it declined but was revived through local initiatives and commercial adaptation. Today, Aipan thrives on canvas, textiles, decor, and digital platforms, evolving from sacred household art to a celebrated heritage craft.</p>

                <p id="food">Uttarakhand once had many traditional dishes that are now rarely seen. Bhatt ki Chudkani or Dubuk  was a thick curry made from local black soybeans, while  Chainsoo  was prepared using roasted black gram. People also enjoyed Faanu, a soupy mix of pulses, and Kafuli, a curry of spinach or fenugreek leaves cooked in an iron pan. For sweets, they made Arsa with rice flour and jaggery and Jhangore ki Kheer with barnyard millet. Everyday meals often included Lesu, a stuffed roti of wheat and finger millet, and Rotana or Puliya, simple millet flatbreads eaten with ghee and salt. These foods were highly nutritious and perfectly suited to mountain life but are now cooked mostly during festivals or in rural homes.</p>

                <p id="folk">Uttarakhand is rich in cultural traditions, and its folk dances reflect the lifestyle, festivals, and spirituality of the people. Langvir Nritya, performed by men balancing on a bamboo pole, showcases strength and acrobatics. Barada Nati, popular in Jaunsar and upper Himachal border areas, is performed during festivals and social gatherings. Jhora and  Chhapeli are group dances where men and women hold hands and move in circles, celebrating unity and joy. Thali, Jhainta, and Chauphula are festive dances that mark sowing, harvesting, and religious occasions. Pandav Nritya narrates stories from the Mahabharata, while Mukhota Dance uses colorful masks to depict deities and demons. Each dance is deeply tied to rituals, seasons, and festivals, keeping alive the spirit and traditions of Uttarakhand..</p>
