                     fashion reimagined.</div>
                <p><b>Earlier: </b>Punjabi men wore kurta–pyjama with phulkari-embroidered pagri (turban), while women wore salwar-kameez with colorful phulkari dupattas. Clothing was vibrant, reflecting the agricultural lifestyle.<br><br><br>

<b>Now: </b>Modern wear like jeans, shirts, and western outfits are common. Salwar suits remain popular, while traditional phulkari is now worn mostly on weddings and festivals.<br><br><br>

<b>In short: </b>Traditional attire has shifted from daily life to festive wear, blending with modern fashion while keeping cultural pride alive.</p>
